# NovaSolarAI

The world's first unified autonomous AI platform for solar energy **optimization**, **protection**, and **monetization** across all climates, grids, and regulations.

## Overview
NovaSolar AI is a hardware-agnostic AI system that:
1. **Optimizes** yield with hybrid forecasting and real-time control (20-40% improvement).
2. **Protects** assets with predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.
3. **Monetizes** via VPP trading using reinforcement learning.

Built with FastAPI, PyTorch, XGBoost — MVP in development.

## Key Features
- Real-time data ingestion from inverters/IoT.
- Satellite integration for accurate forecasts (Open-Meteo/Solcast).
- DDPG RL for VPP bidding.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/191Avi/NovaSolar-AI.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn xgboost torch requests`
3. Run backend: `cd backend` → `uvicorn main:app --reload`
4. Access dashboard prototype: [Figma Link Here]

## Roadmap
- Q1 2026: MVP launch (forecasting + alerts).
- Q2: Full VPP integration.
